    "# Maximum Correntropy Kalman Filter\n",
    "\n",
    "- Traditional Kalman Filter (KF) is derived under the well-known minimum mean square error: *MMSE* criterion, which is optimal under Gaussian assumption. However, when the signals are non-Gaussian, **speacially when the system is disturbedd by some heavy-tailed impulsive noises** the performance will detereiorate notoroiusly.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Maximum correntropy Kalman Filter (MCKF) adopts the robust maximum correntropy criterion (*MCC*) instead of using MMSE. \n",
    "\n",
    "- MCKF operates similarly to KF: the state mean vector and covariance matrix propagation equations are used to give prior stimations of the state and covariance matrix. \n",
    "\n",
    "- A fixed-point algorithm is used to update the posterior estimations."

    "- Linear dynamic systems are ussually solved by KF.\n",
    "- The optimization criteria in information theoretic learning (ITL) uses the information theoretic quantities (e.g. entropy) estimated directly from the data instead of the usual second order statistical measures.\n",
    "- The ITL links information theory, non-parametric estimators, and reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHS).\n",
    "- The correntropy is a nonlienar similarity measure in kernel space has it's root in Renyi's entropy. It is also a local similarity measure (hence insensitive to outliers).\n",
    "- In supervised learning, such as regression the problem can be formulated as that of maximizing the correntropy between model output and desired reponse.\n",
    "- **The MCC solution can't be obtained in closed form even for a simple linear regression problem, so one has to solve it using in iterative update algorithm such as the gradient based methods**.\n",
    "- Gradient based methods depend on **a free parameter step-size and ussually converge to an optimal solution slowly**. So, the fixed-point iterative algorithm is an alternative effcient way to solve the MCC solution, which involves no step-size, and may converge to the solution very fast."
